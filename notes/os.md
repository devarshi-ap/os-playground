- assembly code file types:
    - `.a` (Archive) - static library used in Unix-like systems. It contains compiled object files that can be linked into programs
    - `.s` (Source) - contains assembly language source code, which is human-readable code that the assembler translates into machine code
    - `.S` (Source) - similar to `.s` but is first processed by the C preprocessor (cpp). This allows for the inclusion of macros and other preprocessor directives.
    - `.asm` (Assembly) - contains assembly language src. Typically used by assemblers like NASM

#### Â§ Booting ðŸš€

###### Overview

Booting is the process of starting up a computer and loading the OS. It involves several key steps, starting from powering on the hardware to loading the kernel into memory.

###### Steps of the Booting Process

1. **Power-On Self Test (POST) ðŸ”Œ**
   - When you turn on your computer, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) performs a POST to check the hardware components.
   - Think of it as a quick health check-up for your computer's hardware.

2. **BIOS and Bootloader ðŸ“œ**
   - The BIOS looks for a bootable device (e.g., HDD, SSD, USB).
   - It loads the bootloader from the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the selected device into memory.
   - **Mental Model**: Imagine the BIOS as a librarian finding the first page of a book (the bootloader) to start reading.

3. **Bootloader Execution ðŸ”„**
   - The bootloader's job is to load the operating system kernel into memory and transfer control to it.
   - It's a small program that sets up the necessary environment for the kernel to run.

4. **Kernel Loading and Initialization ðŸ§ **
   - The kernel is loaded into memory, and the bootloader hands over control.
   - The kernel initializes hardware components and system processes.

### Example: A Simple Bootloader

Here's an example of a simple bootloader written in assembly:

```assembly
; boot.asm - A simple bootloader example
BITS 16                   ; We are in 16-bit mode
ORG 0x7C00                ; Bootloader loaded at memory address 0x7C00

start:
    mov ah, 0x0E          ; BIOS teletype function
    mov al, 'H'           ; Character to print
    int 0x10              ; BIOS interrupt for teletype output
    mov al, 'i'
    int 0x10
    jmp $                 ; Infinite loop to halt the bootloader

TIMES 510-($-$$) db 0     ; Fill the rest of the 512-byte sector with zeros
DW 0xAA55                 ; Boot signature
